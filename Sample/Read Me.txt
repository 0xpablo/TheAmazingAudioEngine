SimpleSynth
===========

This is a very simple synthesizer app that demonstrates the use of The Amazing Audio Engine.

TPSynthGenerator is an object that implements the AEAudioPlayable protocol, and 
generates a series of sine waves with a simple amplitude envelope to mimic acoustic decay.

TPSynthView responds to touches and triggers notes to be rendered by TPSynthGenerator.

Code for demonstrative purposes only - not to be used elsewhere.

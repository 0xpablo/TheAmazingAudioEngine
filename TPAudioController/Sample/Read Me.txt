SimpleSynth
===========

This is a very simple synthesizer app that demonstrates the use of TPAudioPipeline.

TPSimpleSynth is an object that implements TPAudioPlayable, and generates a series of
sine waves with a simple amplitude envelope to mimic acoustic decay.  A view responds
to touches and triggers notes to be rendered by TPSimpleSynth.


Code for demonstrative purposes only - not to be used elsewhere.
